## Quarto unifies & extends RMarkdown ecosystem

A new open-source scientific and technical publishing system. The goal is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better.

::: illustration
Illustration:

-   Inputs in multiple languages
-   Outputs in multiple formats
-   All going through the same machinery
:::

::: notes
Julie: next up: our outline how we unpack this for you
:::

::: notes
Julie: - Unifies: Rethink the things that evolved organically across RMarkdown for 10 years. "Mosaic" idea. Things that have been "unified" in quarto

-   Extends: doesn't have a dependency or requirement for R; developed to be multilingual, beginning with R, Python, Javascript, and Julia, with the idea that it will work even for languages that don't yet exist.

-   Extends: Has more "guardrails" for users - accessibility and inclusion centered in the design (Mara)

Quarto combines the functionality of R Markdown, bookdown, distill, xaringian, etc into a single consistent system with "batteries included" that reflects everything we've learned from R Markdown over the past 10 years. In addition, many new features are available including extensions for cross-references, figure panels, callouts, advanced page layout, and more. While it is a "new" system, it should also be noted that it is highly compatible with existing content: you can render most R Markdown documents and Jupyter notebooks unmodified with Quarto. J.J. will discuss the philosophy and design of the system, demonstrate its capabilities, and talk about future directions for development.

## PROPOSAL: Mine and her work (a few slides)

I'm a professor, teacher, and creator...

I share everything openly

(open science intro here? maybe focused on artifacts (and Julie reprise, focused on process (slide 35)))

## Next generation R Markdown

::: illustration
**Illustration:** Many "down" hex logos on one side, Quarto logo and some indication of other languages on the other side.
:::

-   5 or 6 things that were in diff formats

-   Side-by-side with quarto vs Rmd

    -   Enumerage: tabsets, code-folding, highlighting. 

::: aside
Mine: It combines/unifies some "down" packages. It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (Python, Julia) and provides that functionality even if you're not coming from the R ecosystem.
:::

## DEMO: Flexibility in the formats

::: demo
**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Take .Rmd and change extension to .qmd
    -   The .Rmd will already have a table and a plot, palmerpenguins
    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a \_quarto.yml, render to website
    -   *To hand-off to Julie: (a tiny website)*
-   yaml completion and yaml errors
:::

::: aside
Mine: ...

## Knit vs render?

::: illustration
**Illustration:** A graphic and a arrow pointing at where they're different, at a high level.

-   Rmd -\> knitr -\> pandoc: R package (rmarkdown) doing the orchestration
-   Qmd -\> knitr/jupyter -\> pandoc: Quarto CLI doing the orchestration
:::

::: aside
Mine: A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?"
:::

## Moving between "things" is easy\* {.small}

*\*but don't call things "easy", need a better adjective...*

Teaching: creating materials and teaching the tools

-   Moving between formats within Quarto is easy: Often need to deliver same/similar content in different formats (documents, slides, book, website) and it's super helpful when transitioning requires minimal futzing around with source code (like Rmd 8 ways...)
-   Moving from R Markdown to Quarto is easy
    -   Is teaching Quarto different from teaching R Markdown? Easier / harder / **not different**?
    -   Potential anecdote: Art history student writing thesis in Quarto. One semester to thesis writing a much less steep learning curve...

::: aside
Mine: As an educator, two things are of utmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books). Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code. This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

## About Julie

I'm a marine ecologist turned data scientist turned open project lead

Long-time RMarkdown user

rstats changed my life - Better science in less time, Kinder science

::: notes
Julie: about me
I built Openscapes with Erin Robinson
:::

## Openscapes {background-image="images/horst_openscapes_champions.jpg" background-size="600px"}

::: notes
Julie: In the open data science landscape, there are many paths forward, as well as opportunities to create new paths together. But a lot of us feel stuck, like these sad animals in the bottom left, or are working alone, like the little hermit crab, with the landscape just out of view. Through the Champions program we will help you explore and navigate these pathways; you'll find common approaches with your team as you identify your trailhead and safely navigate this landscape, and help each other and welcome others as you go.
We mentor and developed and have iterated a whole flywheel for culture change
:::

## Openscapes Flywheel?

# Openscapes \<\> Quarto story begins with NASA

🚀🌏

And helping researchers using NASA Earthdata transition analytical workflows to the Cloud

::: notes
Julie: Erin comes from the NASA community, connected Openscapes approach with needs she knew at NASA
Earth science community is heavily Python oriented
And you'll notice that I'm an R user not Python, and I'm not Earth Science
I won't lie, I was super intimidated, feeling like I was out of my league. Like a squid out of water, and specifically, in outerspace. 

The nicest people - zoom picture? But a lot of new-ness, scary. 
:::

## But I had a secret 

My life had been changed by RMarkdown

I launched Openscapes with RMarkdown - blogdown website, bookdown curriculum, distill blog repurposed as an events page

Experience and confidence built up over years (out of the box!)

## Quarto let be bring my secret to Python/NASA 

I had been collaborating with J.J., we were I believe the first external testers

Quarto dev team support

NASA Mentors saw it and were willing to go for it (growth mindset)


## Earthdata Cloud Cookbook

Catalina's points:

-   left is table of contents, contributing section
-   also cloud hackathon: share with participants ahead of time
-   comfortable sharing open work

::: notes
Julie: this is the first Quarto site we ever made, started in spring 2021. It's beautiful. Automatic beautiful TOC on the right side

Streamlines teamwork: we came together from across silos, with different skills, comfort with coding, different coding language, different tech. Quarto let us see an end-goal in our mind, and then work in one place, and learn to contribute with confidence.

I want to talk about streamlining teamwork in 2 ways: interoperating with tech, and interoperating with people.
:::

## Interoperability with tech (1/2)

creating collections

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshot of portion of `_quarto.yml`: .ipynbs, .rmds, .qmds
:::

::: aside
Julie: language compatibility - using quarto with a python-heavy crowd I'm able to build from what I've learned with R and share with the python crowd (flexibility in the tooling) *Julie TODO: add HLS .Rmd*
:::

## Interoperability with tech (2/2)

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshot .qmd with python and R code
:::

::: aside
Julie: language compatibility - using quarto to support researchers early - first dev is in python but not limited
:::

## Quarto enables interoperability of tech and people

Streamlines teamwork

-   shared vision: code and text together beautifully
-   interoperability with tech
-   interoperability with people

## DEMO: Flexibility in the tooling

::: demo
**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Render Mine's example site in JupyterHub, quarto preview
-   Add `.ipynb`, workflow (code: palmerpenguins in python?)
-   `quarto convert` to .qmd
-   Open in VS Code, show `.qmd` (cmd-shift-k to render \[attention to other tool chains available\])
-   Mention: You install Quarto with a CLI, (like git) so you can work with whatever tooling you want

::: illustration
**Illustration / animation:** Quarto logo with one quadrant showing the words "Quarto enables new ways of sharing & organization" and the others grayed out.
:::

## Use Quarto to accomplish existing goals {.smaller}

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing:

-   Tooling that makes it easy to share what you do with the world on the web is incredibly *useful* -- if it's not easy to make a course website, you won't.
-   It's *useful* to the world -- Open sharing of knowledge, other people can learn from and reuse.
-   It's [useful]{.underline} to you -- It's a way of getting credit for your work, and when it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created".

::: aside
Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what my responsibilities look like, but you might not know my practices. Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output. (Maybe add PPT anecdote here.)
:::

## Different on the outside, similar on the inside

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshots of each next to each other on top row, folder organization of each on the bottom row. Top looks different, bottom looks very similar.

-   Teaching: Course website with obvious folders
-   Writing: Book - R4DS
-   Research: Journal articles

::: aside
Mine: And last 10% to tweak it for your context...
:::

## DEMO: File architecture, books

::: demo
**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Short - "a few things I've learned transitioning Rmd -\> quarto"
-   Change `_bookdown.yml` to `_quarto.yml` - maybe...
-   My bookdown H1 headers were markdown `# Like This`; quarto book will build but the rest of the headers don't show up on the right TOC. Change to yaml `title: Like This`. Also will look right in the viewer.

:::

::: notes
Julie: What Mine just showed was really powerful for me - once I saw what I could do for my current needs, I saw new ways to reuse and reimagine future ideas. I built Openscapes because of what what I saw was possible with RMarkdown, and it has only increased and extended because of Quarto. Let me tell you about Openscapes, and what our work looks like day to day
:::

## We've been learning a lot about helping teams reimagine

Quarto really helps underscore these points

Learning new tech is about behavior change, culture change

(set stories up for visual editor demo)


## Open science is a movement

-   (It's about products (access to data, code, publications))

-   It's about process. Workflows. People. Daily habits. Culture. Open source tooling.

-   [Open software means kinder science](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/open-software-means-kinder-science/) (Lowndes 2019, Scientific American)

It's the way science should be done, but who can participate? Both from a tech and culture perspective

Hugely inspired by Climate Justice, Get Out the Vote movements, rOpenSci, RStudio, RLadies, Mozilla

Urgency. why this matters. Collaborate with people sooner, co-create/reuse not reinvent. Connect the skills to the values with the urgency.

::: notes
if you are already into open science, open source tools like Quarto helps you execute open science. And if you're not already into open science, open source tools like Quarto can be an entryway and motivator to get engaged

There's more emphasis on open science and this is the way science should be done. All these things about open up your process \> one of the challenges have been tools that allow you to easily do these things the things. These allow you to do thie

# Here's what we've learned:

::: notes
Julie: Friday ideas (email to myself)

Creates place (w jupyerhib and GitHub)

Write things down - Gavin and approach and earth data cookbook

And share ideas early like Openscapes original. Teaching culture.
:::

## Create place

Quarto, (w jupyerhib and GitHub) \> Multi-lingual:: big part of NASA story. Tool that makes it easier for diff languages. you might be a beginner or advanced. You can write a pretty beautiful lab manual/book. Bringing togeter to one place.

Create-once-use-often

Reuse

Create place & shared workflows

Reimagining - books

::: notes
Julie: Co-create-once-use-often. less reinventing; focus time on the science.

seeing this enabled with NASA and quarto - but also NOAA Fisheries: https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2022/index.html

Catalina quote: "I still get kudos"
:::

## Make the implicit explicit

Reimagine culture. Write things down

Write things down - Gavin and approach and earth data cookbook

**Build inclusion into your daily work** - onboarding

[Gavin Fay lab manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/)

Prev examples are really exciting for coders. Also important for folks who don't code or don't identify as coders.

Make the implicit explicit - writing things down

::: notes
Julie: This is another way this manifests: Onboarding (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs. little things. Create a learning culture. We've borrowed this idea for Approach Guide Book websites to collaborate on? Not really how we thought about things before
:::

## Share ideas earlier

Share your vision; a way to welcome folks to join you

And share ideas early like Openscapes original. Teaching culture.

websites & blogs

not limited to a final publication (comfortable with imperfect)

::: illustration
**Image:** Openscapes website (blogdown), Lesson Series?
:::

::: aside
As we were getting started, knew we could share as we built out the idea
:::

## Necessary part of all this: Create space. Time.

Takes time to learn and do, open science must be part of people's paid work. Amazing what folks can do together. Across backgrounds, skills expertise.

Learning culture. Inclusion important. trust. etc. Tooling and culture

Examples: Slides from Amy Steiker and Josh London. Learning. messy.

## Openscapes approach: All together now

-   create space and place
-   make the implicit explicit
-   share ideas earlier

::: illustration

This might be dated now 1. Share your ideas earlier (can I see it? yes) - Series book (existed openly even before was fully dev'd) Create a learning culture 2.

-   Visual Editor - friendly for non-coders. Reimagine who participates.
-   Show tips: "I learned this from Mine while we were preparing our slides"
-   Images, Tables
-   Call-outs
-   DOIs
:::

::: aside
Julie: Culture of trust, less reinventing. Meets someone like me where they are and supports them. (Revisit from useR) Not necessarily for existing/experienced users to change their ways but to create an opportunity for including others...

-   Mara: Quarto has more "guardrails" for users - more friendly for sometone who hasn't worked in this environment before \> maybe up in the visual editor part/

::: aside
Visual Editor: Mine's "this functionality exists" vs Julie's "this is designed to be inviting"

You've already seen bits and pieces of the visual editor. it's not just a bag of tricks, it's an inviting environment/ more than the sum of its parts

## Hi, I'm Julie

-   Long-time user of R Markdown, and also Quarto
-   Changed my work-life and my life-life
-   Theme: collaborating

::: aside
Julie: So excited to be here. I am a long-time and prolific user of RMarkdown, and Quarto and love how out-of-the box they are; I can use them for communicating about research, teaching, and collaborating using mostly the defaults. This as you'll see has been helping me push and blur the boundaries of environmental science, open source, and teaching. What I'll share today is a huge team-effort with many colleagues, that also builds from many folks in the R and open science communities.
