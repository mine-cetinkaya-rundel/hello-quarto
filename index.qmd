## [Julie Notes for Title Slide]

Can I have notes for title slide?

::: notes
Julie: Thank you so much, We're excited to be here! Mine and I have been using Quarto for the last year now, and we're excited for the opportunity to talk about how it improves the way we share, collaborate, teach, and reimagine. In short, we're excited to introduce you to Quarto.

Quarto unifies & extends the RMarkdown ecosystem. In unifying the RMarkdown ecosystem, it means that Quarto is for people who love RMarkdown. And in extending the RMarkdown ecosystem, it means that Quarto is for people who don't know R Markdown

:::

::: notes
Thanks Julie!

I remember vividly the first time I've heard of knitr at useR 2012 and sitting in the audience and starting to convert my teaching materials to use it while the keynote was still going on.

I'll call this a success if a few of you are firing up a Quarto project right now to see what all the hype is about.

I'm very excited to have this opportunity to talk to you about Quarto, which I've had the opportunity to live and breathe over the last year. I am an educator -- a developer educator at RStudio and a professor at Duke. The word educator might make you think I'm in front of students, perhaps lecturing 24/7 but in reality I spend more of my time in front of my computer authoring and creating materials to share with the world: share with my students, share with my fellow educators, and share with anyone interested in learning the things I'm teaching. Sometimes I'm writing a slide deck for a talk, sometimes creating a website for a course, sometimes writing books, sometimes journal articles. Whatever it is that I create, I share them all openly - that is, with an open license that allows for free use and reuse and adaptation. More often than not I'm thinking "web first" to ease open sharing and wider reach, but I also still live in the confines of traditional journal publishing and academia, which means I regularly need to create PDFs as well. So an authoring system that allows for multiple types of outputs from a single source is not only a time saver, but basically essential for me to carry on my existence.

## Next generation R Markdown

![](images/rmd-to-quarto.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Mine: It combines/unifies some "down" packages. It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (Python, Julia) and provides that functionality even if you're not coming from the R ecosystem. Beyond unification, Quarto also makes available attractive and handy features like tabsets, code-folding, syntax highlighting, etc. consistently across the various outputs.
:::

## DEMO: Flexibility in the formats

::: demo
**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Take .Rmd and change extension to .qmd
    -   The .Rmd will already have a table and a plot, palmerpenguins
    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options, YAML completion, YAML errors (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a `_quarto.yml`, render to website
    -   *To hand-off to Julie: (a tiny website)*
-   yaml completion and yaml errors
:::

Mine: ...

## Knit vs render?

-   Rmd -\> knitr -\> pandoc: R package (rmarkdown) doing the orchestration
-   Qmd -\> knitr/jupyter -\> pandoc: Quarto CLI doing the orchestration
:::

::: notes
Mine: A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?"
:::

## Moving between "things" is ~~easy~~ straightforward

Moving between formats within Quarto is straightforward

-   Often need to deliver same/similar content in different formats (documents, slides, book, website)
-   It's super helpful when transitioning requires minimal futzing around with source code (like Rmd 8 ways...)

::: notes
Mine: As an educator, two things are of utmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books). Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code. This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

::: notes
Julie: I'm a marine ecologist and I direct a program called Openscapes to support research teams transitioning to modern and inclusive open data science workflows.

It's an understatement to say that the R community changed my life; My path can be summarized in these 5 images: 

The Ocean Health Index, where my marine ecology research team learned the hard way that we couldn't reproduce our own work with our default approaches to data analysis and collaboration.

R (RMarkdown and the tidyverse) completely played an underpinning role in our transition to better science in less time 

A Mozilla Fellowship helped me launch Openscapes and shift my career away from research and towards supporting research teams 

And Erin Robinson partnered developed it into a sustainable and scalable model

# Openscapes' Quarto story begins with NASA {.julie}

🚀🌏

::: notes
Our Quarto story begins with NASA. Let me give you some background here about NASA and our project.
In 1960, the United States put its first Earth-observing environmental satellite into orbit around the planet. Over the decades, these satellites have provided invaluable information, and the vantage point of space has provided new perspectives on Earth. 

These images are collected across space and time and help us understand floodplains, etc

Let me share with you some of the images of Earth that NASA creates from remotely-sensed satellite imagery, because it's so beautiful. 

The nicest people - zoom picture? But a lot of new-ness, scary.

Gorgeous images like this one of 

Phytoplankton Bloom
Baltic Sea
In this Landsat 7 image from 2005, massive congregations of greenish phytoplankton swirl in the dark water around Gotland, a
Swedish island in the Baltic Sea. Phytoplankton are microscopic marine plants that form the first link in nearly all ocean food chains.
Population explosions, or blooms, of phytoplankton, like the one shown here, occur when deep currents bring nutrients up to sunlit
surface waters, fueling the growth and reproduction of these tiny, photosynthesizing organisms.

NASA is Erin's community, but this was all very new and intimidating to me.

Julie: this is the first Quarto site we ever made, started in spring 2021. It's beautiful. It's a collection of how to guides and tutorials - we could organize what we had and make placeholders for where we saw gaps as we developed them together. It helped us all come together as a team, from across silos, with different skills, comfort with coding, different coding language, different tech. Quarto let us see an end-goal in our mind, and then work in one place, and learn to contribute with confidence.

# Teach

![](images/quadrants-teach.gif){fig-align="center"}

## Use Quarto to accomplish existing goals {.smaller}

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing:

-   Tooling that makes it easy to share what you do with the world on the web is incredibly *useful* -- if it's not easy to make a course website, you won't.
-   It's *useful* to the world -- Open sharing of knowledge, other people can learn from and reuse.
-   It's [useful]{.underline} to you -- It's a way of getting credit for your work, and when it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created".

::: notes
Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what my responsibilities look like, but you might not know my practices. Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output. (Maybe add PPT anecdote here.)
:::

## Different on the outside, similar on the inside

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshots of each next to each other on top row, folder organization of each on the bottom row. Top looks different, bottom looks very similar.

-   Teaching: Course website with obvious folders
-   Writing: Book - R4DS

## DEMO: File architecture, books

**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Short - "a few things I've learned transitioning Rmd -\> quarto"
-   Change `_bookdown.yml` to `_quarto.yml` - maybe...
-   My bookdown H1 headers were markdown `# Like This`; quarto book will build but the rest of the headers don't show up on the right TOC. Change to yaml `title: Like This`. Also will look right in the viewer.

## Moving between "things" is ~~easy~~ straightforward

Moving from R Markdown to Quarto is straightforward:

-   Is teaching Quarto different from teaching R Markdown? Easier / harder / **not different**?
-   Potential anecdote: Art history student writing thesis in Quarto. One semester to thesis writing a much less steep learning curve...

# Reimagine

Julie: What Mine just showed was really powerful for me - once I saw what I could do for my current needs, I saw new ways to reuse and reimagine future ideas. I built Openscapes because of what what I saw was possible with RMarkdown, and it has only increased and extended because of Quarto. Let me tell you about Openscapes, and what our work looks like day to day

It's the way science should be done, but who can participate? Both from a tech and culture perspective

if you are already into open science, open source tools like Quarto helps you execute open science. And if you're not already into open science, open source tools like Quarto can be an entryway and motivator to get engaged

There's more emphasis on open science and this is the way science should be done. All these things about open up your process \> one of the challenges have been tools that allow you to easily do these things the things. These allow you to do thie

But when Erin Robinson joined Openscapes she brought expertise in scaling programs and making them sustainable. She introduced this idea of the Flywheel of the steps needed to really create lasting culture change. 

It involves focusing beyond delivering the Champions program; and how there is a whole series of steps that interplay...

Transition - we've worked with 70+ research teams, and what this looks like for them is said beautifully by Dr. Adyan Rios:

## Create space 

Prioritize time.

Build trust, psychological safety, inclusion

Ask how people work, where they're stuck, what they know.

Foster a learning culture. And a teaching culture. Empathy. Growth Mindset. Meet people where they are.

Learning. messy. Don't need to have a plan, just you want to do better. make the space. Takes time to learn and do, amazing what folks can do together. Across backgrounds, skills, expertise.

Managers at NASA, NOAA, faculty at universities. Supporting people's time to learn. open science must be part of people's paid work.

NOAA Cohort right now with 9 Supervisors participating.

Necessary part of reimagining: Time.

This might be dated now 1. Share your ideas earlier (can I see it? yes) - Series book (existed openly even before was fully dev'd) Create a learning culture 2. Reuse: create-once-use-often. less reinventing; focus your time on the science. 3. bring inclusion into your daily work (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs

## Create place

Quarto has been really key for us with NASA Openscapes (also JupyterHub, GitHub, Google Docs)

Where we put things, what contributing looks like

Catalina quote: share with participants ahead of time, "I still get kudos"

Reuse: Create-once-use-often. Reused 10x since

seeing this enabled with NASA and quarto - but also NOAA Fisheries: https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2022/index.html

## Share ideas earlier

not limited to a final publication

Catalina's quote: comfortable sharing open work, imperfect

::: notes
As we were getting started, knew we could share as we built out the idea

## Find the common

## Make the implicit explicit

Make the implicit explicit - writing things down

**Build inclusion into your daily work** - onboarding

Julie: This is another way this manifests: Onboarding (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs. little things. Create a learning culture. We've borrowed this idea for Approach Guide Book websites to collaborate on? Not really how we thought about things before

1.  "Diagram feature" maybe code \| output

2.  Works with Shiny - that's all to say

3.  Quarto pub? What it accomplishes \| what it looks like

4.  Freeze \> blog posts, jupyter notebooks

5.  Each book chapter starting in a fresh session opening as you'd expect them to

6.  Table \> 2 tables next to each other

7.  Table in the margin

8.  Chalkboard on slides

9.  multiplex: Slides / scroll for audience

10. Downlit (link directly to mutate function documentation pkgdown)

11. Include xaringan slides in Quarto project with resources

12. `quarto publish`
