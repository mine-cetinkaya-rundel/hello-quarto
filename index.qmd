Thank you so much, we're excited to be here!
Mine and I have been using Quarto for the last year; she has been teaching and contributing to the development of Quarto it since its earliest days and Openscapes has been the first external users of Quarto.
As we've woven it into our work we realize we love it, and we're thrilled to welcome you to Quarto.
:::

# Hello, Quarto? {.title-top-light background-image="images/horst-quarto-meteor-transparent.png" aria-label="A meteor where the head of the meteor is the Quarto logo."}

::: notes
But also, we know you have questions.
We did too.
What is Quarto?
Why is Quarto?
And how does it relate to R Markdown and the workflows you already have?

--\> Well

::: notes
It unifies it for people who love R Markdown by reducing little points of friction, so that websites, books, and slides all have a common approach.

And it extends it for people who don't know RMarkdown by being a friendly way to work reproducibly and publish documents that have text and code in the same place

The goal is to make the process of creating and collaborating dramatically better.

If you would like to start sharing, collaborating, teaching, and reimagining with Quarto by picking up where we left off, go to this link and scroll forward to see the next few slides where we share resources for learning as well as references for the works we presented today.
And if you have any questions about Quarto or R Markdown, please stop by the Open Source table in the Lounge between 12-3pm today.
And don't miss the Quarto session at 3:20pm!
:::

# Thank you {.title-top-dark background-image="images/horst_quarto_penguins_thankyou.png"}

::: notes
Thank you so much for joining us this morning, here in person or from wherever you are tuning in to the live stream.
We've talked about our experiences using Quarto and all the problems it has helped us solve and reimagine, but while Quarto is stable and ready for use, it's also a baby that you too can be a part of its growth.
So start using Quarto, and get involved by asking questions, reporting issues, providing feedback, and even building extensions for it.
We can't wait to see what you create!

So, earth, pale blue dot<br> We will fail you not.<br>

Just as we chose to go to the moon<br> We know it's never too soon<br> To choose hope.<br> We choose to do more than cope<br> With climate change<br> We choose to end it---<br> We refuse to lose.<br> Together we do this and more<br> Not because it's very easy or nice<br> But because it is necessary,<br> Because with every dawn we carry<br> the weight of the fate of this celestial body orbiting a star.<br> And as heavy as that weight sounded, it doesn't hold us down,<br> But it keeps us grounded, steady, ready,<br> Because an environmental movement of this size<br> Is simply another form of an earthrise.<br>
